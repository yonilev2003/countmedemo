# Israeli Bituach Leumi (National Insurance)

## Critical Note
Bituach Leumi rules are complex and amounts update twice a year (January and July) tied to the average wage. Always direct users to verify their specific case at btl.gov.il, the personal area at https://ps.btl.gov.il, or by calling *6050. Amounts in this skill reflect the official 2026 rate announcement (`btl.gov.il/About/news/Pages/hadasaidkonkitzva2026.aspx`).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Benefit Program
Map the user's situation to the correct program. The 13 main programs are listed in `references/benefit-programs.md`.

### Step 2: Check Eligibility
Each program has its own qualifying period. The full table is in `references/benefit-programs.md` under "Qualifying Periods". Key factors:
- Residency status (תושב vs. non-resident; new immigrants have special rules)
- Age (retirement, work, minor)
- Employment history (qualifying period, called תקופת אכשרה)
- Income level (some benefits are means-tested)
- Medical condition (for disability, long-term care, work injury)
- Marital and family status

### Step 3: Estimate Benefit Amount
Use `scripts/calculate_benefits.py` for old-age pension, unemployment, maternity, child allowance, miluim, and birth grant estimates. All hardcoded amounts reflect 2026 rates.

### Step 4: File the Claim
Identify the correct form (see `## Forms` below) and the right filing channel (see `## Digital Channels`). Most claims are now filed digitally through the personal area at https://ps.btl.gov.il, with the form-PDF auto-generated from the wizard.

### Step 5: Track and Appeal
Three appeal tracks exist (medical, non-medical, labor court). See `## Appeals` below for the deadlines and the right venue per decision type.

## Key Programs Detail

All amounts are **2026 official rates**. Rates update January 1 and July 1.

### Old Age Pension (Kitzbat Zikna)
- **Retirement age (גיל פרישה):** Men 67. Women 62 to 65, depending on birth-month cohort. The Knesset passed תיקון מס' 7 in 2021 that resumed raising women's retirement age starting June 2022, by 4 months/year. Final age 65 is reached for women born after April 1960; full schedule completes around 2032. Use the official BTL retirement-age calculator at btl.gov.il/benefits/old_age/Pages/RetirementCalculation.aspx.
- **Absolute eligibility age (גיל הזכאות המוחלטת):** 70 for everyone. Pension is paid regardless of income.

### General Disability (Nechut Klalit)
- **Distinct from work injury (nechut me'avoda)**: different program, different forms.
- **Eligibility:** Resident aged 18 to retirement age with medical incapacity reducing earning capacity by 60%, 65%, 74%, or 75-100%. Requires 12 months of NI residency before disability.

### Work Injury (Pgi'at Avoda)
- **Eligibility:** Any worker injured on the job or commuting; covered from day 1 of employment (no qualifying period). Self-employed must be registered with BTL before the injury.
- **Injury pay (dmei pgi'a):** 75% of last 3 months average wage, paid for up to 91 days.

- **Permanent disability (after 91 days):** Determined by medical committee; lump-sum or pension based on disability percentage.
- **Claim forms:** **211** (initial injury-pay claim and notification, the "tofes 211" most people refer to), **200** (permanent disability degree), **250** (medical-treatment authorization for employees), **283** (same for self-employed), **284** (employer declaration).
- **Common confusion:** "Form 100" is NOT a BTL employer report for unemployment. Form 100 in BTL is the opt-out from employer outreach. The actual employer attachment to a 1500 unemployment claim is form 1514. The "100" most accountants refer to is a Tax Authority payslip-summary form, not a BTL form.

### Reserve Duty (Miluim)
- **Eligibility:** Any IDF reservist; covered from day 1 (no qualifying period). Claim window: 7 years from end of service.

- **Annual bonus tiers (Iron Swords-era):** Enhanced rates for cumulative miluim days/year, ~2,000 to ~10,000+ NIS depending on tier.
- **Salaried employees:** Employer pays salary as usual; BTL refunds the employer via form 501. The employee receives the full salary.

### Long-term Care (Siyud)

- **Income test (2026):** Single < 12,536 NIS/month; couple < 18,804 NIS/month for full benefit. Reduced for higher incomes.
- **Cash amounts (2026):** Level 1, 1,659 NIS; Level 6, 7,238 NIS. Recipients can elect cash payment OR care services delivered by approved providers.
- **Foreign caregiver (metapel zar):** Interaction with the Population Authority's permit; the cash benefit can supplement the caregiver's wage.
- **Claim form:** **2600** (תביעה לגמלת סיעוד). Form **2655** to elect cash-instead-of-services.

- **Claim forms:** **410** (survivors pension claim), **416** (death grant + pension balance), **2910** (orphan maintenance).

## Forms (טפסים)

Bituach Leumi runs ~85 numbered claim forms (טפסים) across the 13 programs above. The full catalog with form numbers, Hebrew names, who files each, and notes is in **`references/forms.md`** (organized by program: maternity, child allowance, old-age, survivors, unemployment, disability, work injury, vocational rehab, miluim, income support, alimony, employer bankruptcy, burial, long-term care, mobility, hostile-action victims, treaty / abroad, self-employed contributions, representation, general-purpose).

Most claims are filed digitally through the personal area at **https://ps.btl.gov.il**, where the form-PDF is auto-generated from the wizard. PDF originals live at **https://www.btl.gov.il/טפסים-ואישורים** under per-program subfolders.

> **Form 900 is NOT a benefit claim.** It is the general "Personal Details Update" form (הודעה על עדכון פרטים אישיים) used by anyone already receiving a benefit to change their address, marital status, or bank account.
>
> **Form 100 in BTL** is the opt-out from employer-outreach, NOT an employer report. The actual employer attachment to a 1500 unemployment claim is form **1514**. The "100" most accountants reference is a Tax Authority payslip-summary form, not a BTL form.

## Contribution Rates (2026)

NI is collected on income up to a monthly cap, with two brackets:

- **Bracket boundary (60% of average wage):** 7,703 NIS/month.
- **Maximum insurable income (תקרה):** 51,910 NIS/month.

| Payer | Bracket 1 (up to 7,703) | Bracket 2 (7,703 to 51,910) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee (deducted from salary) | 1.04% NI + 3.23% health = **4.27%** | 7.0% NI + 5.17% health = **12.17%** |
| Employer (in addition to wage) | 4.51% | 7.60% |
| Self-employed | 4.47% NI + 3.23% health = **7.7%** | 12.83% NI + 5.17% health = **18.0%** |

> **Amendment 252 (תיקון 252):** the 2026 rate increases above are set by Amendment 252 to the National Insurance Law, enacted 2025-01-14. Rates are CPI-indexed for 2026 through 2028 and switch to wage indexation from 2029.

Self-employed pay both shares (employee + employer-equivalent) and cannot claim unemployment. They can claim every other benefit. Verify rates against the live BTL pages (`btl.gov.il/Insurance/.../rates.aspx`) at filing time, rates can shift mid-year on amendment.

## Examples

### Example 1: Maternity Leave
User says: "I'm pregnant and want to know about maternity leave benefits."
1. Confirm employment duration to determine 15 weeks vs 8 weeks.
2. Calculate daily benefit using `python scripts/calculate_benefits.py maternity --salary X --months-employed Y` (capped at 1,752.33 NIS/day in 2026).
3. Mention birth grant (2,103 NIS first child; 10,514 for twins) and the partner-week split.
4. Direct to filing: form 355 (or 356 combined) via the personal area at ps.btl.gov.il.

### Example 2: Retirement Planning
User says: "When can I start getting pension from Bituach Leumi?"
1. If the user is a man, retirement age is 67. If a woman, retirement age depends on birth-month cohort (currently 62 to 65; the schedule is being raised by 4 months/year since 2022). Use the official calculator at btl.gov.il/benefits/old_age/Pages/RetirementCalculation.aspx.
2. Explain the income test between retirement age and 70.
3. Quote the basic 2026 amount (1,838 NIS single, 1,941 from age 80, 2,762 couple). Note that most pensioners get the +50% seniority supplement, bringing the effective single rate to ~2,757 NIS.
4. Direct to form 480 (תביעה לקצבת אזרח ותיק).

### Example 3: Reserve Duty Compensation
User says: "I did 30 days of miluim, how much will Bituach Leumi pay me?"
1. If the user is a salaried employee, the employer pays the salary as usual; BTL refunds the employer via form 501. The user receives full salary, no separate BTL payment.
2. If the user is self-employed or paid below the cap, file a personal claim using form 502.
3. Calculation: last 3 months average daily wage (gross divided by 90), capped at 1,730.33 NIS/day, minimum 328.76 NIS/day.
4. Add the Iron Swords annual bonus tier if cumulative days for the year exceed 10.
5. Mention the 7-year claim window from end of service.

### Example 4: Filing a Disability Claim
User says: "I have a chronic illness, how do I file a disability claim?"
1. Distinguish general disability (nechut klalit) from work-related (nechut me'avoda), different programs, different forms, different funding sources.
2. For general disability: file form 7801 (under retirement age) at the personal area.
3. The medical committee determines incapacity percentage (60%, 65%, 74%, or 75-100%). The 2026 monthly amounts are 2,718 / 2,894 / 3,211 / 4,711 NIS respectively.
4. If the user needs daily personal-care assistance, also file form 7849 for special services (SHRM).

## Gotchas
- BTL contribution rates have two brackets: a reduced rate up to 60% of the average wage (7,703 NIS in 2026), and the normal rate above it. Agents almost always apply a single flat rate.
- Self-employed pay both the employee and employer shares of NI (7.7% reduced bracket and 18.0% full bracket in 2026, per Amendment 252). Agents may calculate only the employee share, underestimating the obligation by ~2x.
- Self-employed are NOT eligible for unemployment (dmei avtala), only שכירים are. This is a common user expectation that fails.
- Form 900 is the personal-details update form, NOT a benefit claim. Users frequently search "form 900" expecting it to be a maternity or other benefit form.
- "Form 100" in BTL context is the opt-out from employer outreach, NOT an employer report. The actual employer attachment to a 1500 unemployment claim is form 1514. The "100" non-BTL form most accountants reference is a Tax Authority payslip-summary form.
- Resignation triggers a 90-day disqualification from unemployment unless quitting for justified cause (relocation, family-care, deterioration of conditions). The standard "5-day waiting period" only applies to terminations.
- Mobility (niyadut) is a two-step process: medical determination at the Ministry of Health (form 8220), THEN BTL benefit (form 8200). Filing only one of them is a common mistake.
- Women's retirement age is NOT yet 65 across the board. The 2021 amendment resumed the gradual increase from 62; women's actual retirement age in 2026 depends on birth-month cohort (62 to 65). Use the official calculator.
- The average wage (sachir memutza) used for benefit calculations is updated twice a year (January and July) by the CBS. Outdated figures will cause rate calculations to drift.
- Old-age pension has an income test between retirement age and 70. Above ~7,827 NIS/month single income, the pension is suspended until age 70. Agents quote the basic amount unconditionally.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Not enough qualifying months"
Cause: Insufficient contribution history (תקופת אכשרה).
Solution: Check the per-program qualifying-period table in `references/benefit-programs.md`. Some periods (military service, maternity leave, miluim) count as qualifying months. New immigrants (olim) have special rules; for old-age, the 60-month minimum can be waived via מענק מותנה.

### Error: "Benefit amounts don't match expected values"
Cause: BTL updates benefit amounts twice a year (January and July) tied to the average wage.
Solution: Verify current amounts at https://www.btl.gov.il/About/news/Pages/hadasaidkonkitzva2026.aspx or via *6050. Amounts in this skill reflect the official 2026 announcement; check the live page for mid-year revisions.

### Error: "Form not found at the URL I tried"
Cause: BTL form pages are organized in per-program subfolders under `btl.gov.il/טפסים-ואישורים/forms/<program>_forms/Pages/`.
Solution: Use the master form-search at https://www.btl.gov.il/טפסים-ואישורים/FormSearch/Pages/default.aspx. PDF originals are at `btl.gov.il/טפסים-ואישורים/Documents/t<form-number>.pdf` (e.g. `t355.pdf`).

### Error: "I resigned and was denied unemployment"
Cause: Voluntary resignation triggers a 90-day disqualification.
Solution: If the resignation was for justified cause (relocation following spouse, family-care, hazardous-conditions, deterioration of work conditions, fixed-term contract end), file an appeal with form 7810 within 60 days. Document the cause carefully.
